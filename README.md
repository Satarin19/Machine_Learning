# Machine_Learning
Repo contains the Machine Learning Project on human activity classification which can classify the activity being performed by the user based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.
For the project the dataset on kaggle datasets download -d uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones was used and further predictions were made by training the model using NB and Logistic Regression classifiers and predictions were made. Even the accuracy and time taken by different models was observed and Logistic Regression Newton-cg solver using l2 penalty was found to be the best fit for the model.
