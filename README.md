# Machine_Learning (Human Activity Recognition Using NB and Logistic Regression)
Repo contains the Machine Learning Project on human activity classification which can classify the activity being performed by the user based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.
For the project the dataset Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones [download -d uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphone](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones) was used and further predictions were made by training the model using NB and Logistic Regression classifiers and predictions were made. Even the accuracy and time taken by different models was observed and Logistic Regression Newton-cg solver using l2 penalty was found to be the best fit for the model.
Some quick insights about the dataset.

# About Dataset
The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed from the following:
* Laying
* Standing
* Walking
* Walking upstairs
* Walking downstairs
* Sitting
